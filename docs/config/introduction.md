### Configuration

Pumpkin offers a robust configuration system that allows users to customize various aspects of the server's behavior without relying on external plugins. This provides flexibility and control over the server's operation.

### Basic / Advanced

Pumpkin's Configuration is split into a basic Configuration made for quick changes and important changes and a more Advanced Configuration

- `configuration.toml`: simple and can be compared to the vanilla `server.properties`.
- `features.toml`: designed to have all features of pumpkin at one place, making it a large configuration

### Server Version

Pumpkin only supports the latest version of Minecraft. If you want to host a Pumpkin server in any other version, there is a project called [ViaProxy](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaProxy).

- Make sure to allow Proxy connections.
- Pumpkin and ViaProxy have no connection, don't submit issues reguarding their code.

#### Key Features:

- Extensive Customization: Configure server settings, player behavior, world generation, and more.
- Performance Optimization: Optimize server performance through configuration tweaks.
- Plugin-Free Customization: Achieve desired changes without the need for additional plugins.
