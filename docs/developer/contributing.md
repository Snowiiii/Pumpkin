#### Reporting Bugs
  If you encounter a bug, please search for existing issues on the issue tracker first.

  Follow the template and provide a clear description of the bug, including steps to reproduce it if possible.
  Screenshots, logs, or code snippets can also be helpful.

#### Suggesting Features

#### Contributing Code
  To get started with contributing code to Pumpkin, fork the repository on github

- First create a github account if you don't already have one
 
- Go to Pumpkin's Official [Github Repository](https://github.com/Snowiiii/Pumpkin) and press fork

> Creating a fork means you now have your own copy of the Pumpkin source code, (this does not mean you own the copyright)

  Now that you have a copy that you can edit, you will need a few tools

- Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for your operating system

- To get started with git, visit [Getting started with Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git)

- Optional: If you want a graphical tool to interact with Github, install [Github-Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/)

> Github Desktop may be easier if you are not used to the command line, but it is not for everyone

- To get started with Github Desktop, visit [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop)

- If you are wanting to contribut code, install Rust at [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

- If you are wanting to contribute to documentation, install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)

### Additional Information
