### Coding Guidelines

- **Working with Tokio and Rayon:**
  When invoking CPU intensive work, this work should be done in the Rayon thread pool via `rayon::spawn`, Rayon's
  parallel iterators, or otherwise instead of from the Tokio runtime. However, it is important that the
  Tokio runtime not block on these Rayon calls. Instead, the data should be passed to the Tokio runtime
  via async means, for example: `tokio::sync::mpsc`. An example of how to properly do this can be found
  in `pumpkin_world::level::Level::fetch_chunks`.
